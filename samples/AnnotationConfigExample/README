Annotation Configuration Example Play 2.0 Application
=====================================================

This application shows an example of using the Spring framework with annotation-based configuration
for injecting Spring dependencies. Earlier version of Play and the Spring Module required extra
configuration for Spring's component scanning and annotation configuration. With the new version of
Play 2.0 this is no longer required because behind the scenes the Play framework is not magically
manipulating the classpath. To enable annotation configuration all you need to do is set up the
appropriate spring context using the annotation-config and component-scan elements. Here's an
example:

>
>    <context:annotation-config />
>    <context:component-scan base-package="beans" />
>

With this configuration all the classes under the package "beans" will be scanned for their
dependencies and loaded into the appliction's context.

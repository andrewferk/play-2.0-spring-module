Basic Spring-based Example Play 2.0 Application
===============================================

This application is a very simple spring-based application that obtains a named bean from spring
and display's it's name. When this application is run you should see the output below. This beans
that a Spring bean was instantiated and spring injected the name of the beans name.  

>
> MyBean.getBeanName() = MyBean
>

By default the plugin will always look at the "conf/applications-context.xml". However sometimes
you want to override this behavior in these cases you should supply the following parameter in your
application.conf:

>
> spring.context = another-application-context.xml
>

If you change the context to "conf/another-application-context.xml" as shown above the output of
the application should change to what is shown below. This reflects the new name of the bean from
the other application context.

> 
> MyBean.getBeanName() = Another_Name_For_My_Bean
>
